# Welcome to My Digital Garden

This website functions as a personal note-taking space for me. It's a collection of my thoughts, ideas, and learnings that I've decided to share publicly.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Personal Notes**: Thoughts and reflections on various topics
- **Learning Journey**: Documentation of things I'm currently learning
- **Ideas and Concepts**: Explorations of interesting ideas I come across

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this site is to serve as my external brain. By writing things down and organizing my thoughts here, I'm able to:

1. Better understand complex concepts
2. Keep track of my learning progress
3. Easily reference information I've collected
4. Potentially help others who might find this information useful

Feel free to explore and navigate through my notes. Keep in mind that this is a constantly evolving space, and notes may be updated or expanded over time.

## How to Navigate

- Use the search function to find specific topics
- Browse through the folder structure to see how content is organized
- Check out the graph view to see how different notes are connected

Thank you for visiting my digital garden. I hope you find something interesting or useful here!
